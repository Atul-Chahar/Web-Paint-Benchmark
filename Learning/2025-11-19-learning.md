# Daily Learning Log: Web Paint Benchmark
**Date:** 2025-11-19
**Author:** Atul Chahar / Anant Sharma
**Project Phase:** Week 1 - UI & Harness 

## 1. Project Overview
Today, I formalized the initial work on the **Web Paint Benchmark** project. The goal is to create a simplified, "Lighthouse-style" audit tool that provides a professional "Performance Score" focusing on rendering and visual stability.

* **Core Problem:** Developers struggle to understand why webpages feel slow without complex tools.
* **Solution:** A dashboard that inputs a URL, runs a performance audit, and outputs a 0-100 score.
* **Stack:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript.

## 2. Today's Progress
### UI Architecture
* Drafted the basic structure for the "Audit Interface" (landing page) where users input the target URL.
* Created the `initial-design.md` file to store the layout wireframes and CSS structure.
* **Goal:** Ensure the visual fidelity mimics a professional tool like Lighthouse.


### Technical Research: PerformanceObserver API
I focused on understanding the **PerformanceObserver API**, which is the core logic requirement for gathering the scoring data.

#### What is PerformanceObserver?
The `PerformanceObserver` interface is a JavaScript API used to observe performance measurement events and be notified of new performance entries as they are recorded in the browser's performance timeline.

**Why we are using it:**
Unlike the older `performance.getEntries()`, which requires polling, `PerformanceObserver` is **asynchronous**. It pushes data to us when events happen, which prevents our scoring logic from interfering with the page's actual performance.

#### Key Concepts Learned:
1.  **Observer Pattern:** We subscribe to specific entry types (like `paint`, `layout-shift`, or `longtask`).
2.  **Buffered Flag:** The `{ buffered: true }` option allows us to capture performance metrics that occurred *before* our script initialized (crucial for capturing page load metrics).
3.  **Paint Timing:** Specifically useful for our "Performance Score" to measure *First Contentful Paint (FCP)*.

#### Implementation Reference
This code snippet serves as the foundation for the "Scoring Engine":

```javascript
// Basic implementation of PerformanceObserver to track Paint events
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  const entries = list.getEntries();

  entries.forEach((entry) => {
    // Logging the metric for the "Health Score" calculation
    console.log(`Metric: ${entry.name}`);
    console.log(`Start Time: ${entry.startTime}`);
    console.log(`Duration: ${entry.duration}`);
    
    // TODO: Send this data to the scoring algorithm [cite: 21]
  });
});

// Start observing "paint" entries (FCP, FP)
// buffered: true ensures we catch paints that happened before this script ran
observer.observe({ type: "paint", buffered: true });
