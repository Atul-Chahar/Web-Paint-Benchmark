# Daily Learning Log: Web Paint Benchmark

*Project Phase:* Week 4 - Gallery & Final Polish

## 1. Today's Focus: Gallery Architecture & UI Refinement
Today, I expanded the project scope to include the *Results Gallery* and improved the Landing Page onboarding.
* *Goal:* Allow users to save their benchmark results and view how other devices (e.g., "S25 Ultra") performed on the same test.
* *UI Update:* Redesigned the Landing Page to include clear project descriptions, helping users understand the "Why" before they test.

## 2. Technical Implementation: The Gallery Data Structure
To build the "Hall of Fame" or Gallery, I had to define exactly what data comprises a "Test Result." I created a standardized JSON structure to capture the session data.

### Data Model Design
When a user finishes a test, we generate a result object to be saved:

```javascript
const testResult = {
    id: Date.now(),             // Unique ID (Timestamp)
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    deviceInfo: {
        model: "Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra", // Retrieved or User Input
        browser: "Chrome 132.0",           // From navigator.userAgent
        platform: "Android"
    },
    metrics: {
        totalScore: 92,         // The 0-100 calculated score
        fcp: "0.8s",            // First Contentful Paint
        fpsAvg: 58              // From our Stress Test
    }
};
