## 1. Today's Focus: Accessibility (A11y) Implementation
Today, I focused on refining the user interface to ensure it is inclusive and accessible.
* **Goal:** Enhance the UX so the dashboard is usable via keyboard navigation and screen readers.
* [cite_start]**Context:** As we aim for a "professional report UI"[cite: 23], accessibility is a non-negotiable standard.

## 2. Technical Implementation
I audited the existing HTML/CSS and implemented several key A11y features.

### A. Semantic HTML & ARIA Labels
I ensured that non-text elements (like icons or charts) have descriptive text for screen readers.
* **Action:** Added `aria-label` and `aria-live` attributes to the dynamic score gauge.
* **Why:** When the score updates from 0 to 100, screen readers need to announce the change.

```html
<div class="score-circle">85</div>

<div 
  class="score-circle" 
  role="progressbar" 
  aria-valuenow="85" 
  aria-valuemin="0" 
  aria-valuemax="100"
  aria-label="Performance Score">
  <span>85</span>
</div>
